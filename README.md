#Final Project

##Overview

My web app will act as a surf forcast social network platform. It will (hopefully) combine forcast of your favorite waves combined with comments and input from other users online. Instagram will also be implemented through the use of hashtags, for instance, if you are on the Rockaway Beach forcast, any instagram post with #rockawaybeach will be shown. If time permits I would also like to send text updates to users when a forcast reaches a certain threshold.

###Logged In
Users who log in are directed to their homepage where they can see a list of favorite surf spots, a search box for finding new spots, and recent social (comments, etc) activity. By clicking on a favorite spot or finding a new one the user can see a bunch of different information (weather charts, maps, weather, swell height) regarding forcasts supplied by the API.
