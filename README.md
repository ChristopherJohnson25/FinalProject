# Final Project

##Overview

My web app will act as a surf forcast social network platform. It will (hopefully) combine forcast of your favorite waves combined with comments and input from other users online. Instagram will also be implemented through the use of hashtags, for instance, if you are on the Rockaway Beach forcast, any instagram post with #rockawaybeach will be shown. If time permits I would also like to send text updates to users when a forcast reaches a certain threshold.
