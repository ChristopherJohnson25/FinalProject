#Final Project

##Overview

My web app will act as a surf forcast social network platform. It will (hopefully) combine forcast of your favorite waves combined with comments and input from other users online. Instagram will also be implemented through the use of hashtags, for instance, if you are on the Rockaway Beach forcast, any instagram post with #rockawaybeach will be shown. If time permits I would also like to send text updates to users when a forcast reaches a certain threshold.

##User Stories

Users can view surf reports of many different waves around the world. Once a user has navigated to a particular report page, they can view images and comment on the surf spot. This is a quick, easy, and elegant web app that sifts through all the extras that every other surf forecast website is bogged down by.
